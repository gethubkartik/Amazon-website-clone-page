## 🌐 Amazon Web Clone

I created an Amazon web clone using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project features a fully responsive design, including the navigation bar, search bar, and product display sections, closely mirroring the original Amazon site. 🛒

- Responsive layout
- Product categories
- Detailed footer

This project highlights my front-end development skills and my ability to build complex web layouts without using JavaScript.
