Created an Amazon web clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring key parts like the navigation bar, search bar, and product display sections. The project is fully responsive and includes interactive elements for a better user experience. The design closely matches the original Amazon site, with various product categories and a detailed footer. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills and ability to build complex web layouts.
